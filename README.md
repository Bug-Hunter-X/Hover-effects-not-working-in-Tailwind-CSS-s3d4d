# Hover effects not working in Tailwind CSS
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where hover effects unexpectedly fail to apply to certain elements.

## Bug Description
The bug is observed when applying specific Tailwind CSS classes to an element, causing hover effects to not work as expected.
The issue is not consistently reproducible, and appears to be related to a complex interaction between different classes or the surrounding HTML structure.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and run the code.
3. Observe that the hover effect on the div element doesn't work as expected.

## Solution
The solution involves identifying and addressing the specific conflicting classes or structural issues. This may involve trying different class combinations or restructuring the HTML. 
For this example, we've resolved the issue by adding an important flag. This is not an ideal solution, but it shows one way to solve the bug.
